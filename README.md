# Advent of Code 2022
... just solving some [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) puzzles using typescript.


## Running code
Given a `day` like `day08`, and a part like `part1`, run this command:
```
npx ts-node day08/part1.ts
```

## Running tests
Given a `day` like `day08` and that there actually are tests, you can run them like this:
```
npm test --test-file day08/shared.test.ts
```
